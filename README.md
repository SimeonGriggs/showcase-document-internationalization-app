# @sanity/document-internationalization + Next.js App Directory Example

This is a basic example of creating internationalized content in Sanity and querying for it with the Next.js 13 app router.

It uses:

- [The new beta version of @sanity/document-internationalization](https://github.com/sanity-io/document-internationalization/tree/studio-v3-plugin-v2) to create localized variants of documents
- [The next-sanity package](https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity) for querying and rendering content
- [Next.js Internationalized Routing](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/app-dir-i18n-routing) example starter
